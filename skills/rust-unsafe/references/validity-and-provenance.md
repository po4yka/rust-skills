# Validity and Pointer Provenance

Use this reference before you turn bytes into a typed value, create a reference from a raw
pointer, or perform pointer arithmetic through an integer address.

## Invalid typed values are immediate undefined behavior

Every Rust type has a validity invariant. Creating a value outside that invariant is undefined
behavior at creation time. A later read or dereference is not required.

Common invalid values include:

- a null, dangling, or misaligned reference;
- a `bool` whose byte is not `0` or `1`;
- an enum with no matching discriminant;
- a `NonNull<T>` that contains zero;
- a function pointer that does not point to a compatible function;
- a value whose fields violate a type invariant.

Do not use `mem::zeroed`, `transmute`, or `MaybeUninit::assume_init` to create such a value and
plan to overwrite it later. Keep the storage as `MaybeUninit<T>` until every byte is initialized
and the complete value is valid.

For a partially initialized array, track the initialized prefix. Drop only that prefix on an
error. Convert to `[T; N]` only after all elements exist.

## Reference creation carries the full contract

Creating `&T` or `&mut T` from a raw pointer asserts more than non-nullness. The pointer must be
aligned, dereferenceable for the reference lifetime, initialized with a valid `T`, and compliant
with the aliasing rules. `&mut T` also asserts exclusive access for its lifetime.

Do not create a reference only to recover a raw pointer or compute a field address. Use a raw
borrow such as `&raw const place`, `&raw mut place`, or `ptr::addr_of!` without an intermediate
reference.

Do not extend the lifetime of a reference returned from raw parts. The caller must prove the
owner, allocation, and foreign access all outlive the reference.

## A pointer is not only an address

A pointer carries provenance that identifies which allocation it can access. Converting the
pointer to an integer address and reconstructing it later can lose that information.

Prefer the Strict Provenance APIs:

| Need | API |
| --- | --- |
| Read the numeric address | `pointer.addr()` |
| Reuse provenance with a new address | `pointer.with_addr(address)` |
| Transform only the address | `pointer.map_addr(transform)` |
| Offset within one allocation | `pointer.add`, `sub`, or `offset` with their exact preconditions |

Use `expose_provenance` and `with_exposed_provenance` only when an external interface truly
stores a pointer as an integer and later reconstructs it. This is an explicitly weaker model.
Document the exposure, keep the allocation alive, and test the path under Miri. Do not use an
integer round trip as ordinary pointer arithmetic.

Pointer-to-pointer casts preserve provenance. Pointer-to-integer-to-pointer conversions are the
dangerous boundary.

## Review procedure

1. Name the allocation that supplies provenance.
2. State the valid address range and alignment.
3. State which owner keeps the allocation alive.
4. State when shared or exclusive access starts and ends.
5. Keep storage as `MaybeUninit<T>` until the complete validity proof holds.
6. Run the smallest test under Miri with strict provenance and Tree Borrows.

```bash
MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-strict-provenance" cargo +nightly miri test --locked <filter>
MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-tree-borrows" cargo +nightly miri test --locked <filter>
```

Miri is evidence for the executed path. It is not a proof for unexecuted layouts, schedules, or
foreign code.
