# Review checklist

The full-pass checklist for `rust-discipline`. Run it when a review request or a merge gate asks
for a full pass over a Rust diff. For one changed signature, apply the API design group only.
Every rule it names is stated in full in [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md), in one of the other
reference files, or in the skill named on the question.

If the answer to any question is yes, revise the change before you merge it.

**API design**

1. Any `&String`, `&Vec<T>`, or `&PathBuf` parameter? Use `&str`, `&[T]`, `&Path`, or a named
   `<P: AsRef<..>>` generic.
2. Any `&'a mut Trait` stored in a struct field? Use a generic `H: Trait`, plus forwarding impls
   that carry `+ ?Sized` and delegate through `H::method(self, ..)`.
3. Any callback without `for<'a>` where the caller must not keep the reference? Add the HRTB.
4. Any `pub` accessor that returns `&mut Vec<T>` or `&mut String`? Return `&mut [T]` or
   `&mut str`, and name each length-changing operation. Any public bound that names `&&T`?
5. Any callback stored as `Box<dyn FnMut>` where `Box<dyn Fn>` works? Any `Weak` callback
   registry that drops registrations silently?
6. Any `Fn` bound picked from the `move` keyword instead of the body? Any callback method whose
   lifetime sits on the `impl` block instead of the method?
7. Any published concrete parameter made generic? Ship it in a major version. A reference
   parameter (`&str`, `&Path`, `&[T]`) then breaks every caller that coerces the function to a
   `fn(&T)` pointer or passes it to an `Fn(&T)` bound. Any parameter can break type inference at a
   call site. cargo-semver-checks flags neither.
8. Any new `pub unsafe fn` where a safe wrapper can hold the invariant? Keep the `unsafe fn`
   `pub(crate)` and export the safe wrapper. A `pub unsafe fn` moves the soundness proof to every
   caller. [`rust-unsafe`]

**Panics, errors, and resources**

9. Any new `.unwrap()` outside tests and `examples/`, any `.expect()` whose message states no
   invariant, or any `.lock()` with no stated poisoning policy?
10. Any `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` returned from a library crate? [`rust-code-style`]
11. Any raw `i32` file descriptor held across an error path? Any `Drop` impl with no documented
    field order?
12. Any `_ =>` arm in a match over a crate-private enum? Any `downcast_ref` chain over a closed
    set of types?

**Concurrency, unsafe, FFI, and lints** (owner skills in brackets)

13. Any allocation inside an event-loop tick, a per-item decode loop, or a parser hot path?
    [`rust-hot-path`]
14. Any blocking-lock guard (`std::sync::Mutex` or `RwLock`, `parking_lot`) held across
    `.await`? `clippy::await_holding_lock` finds them. Any blocking syscall inside async code with
    no `spawn_blocking` and no dedicated thread? [`rust-async-internals`]
15. Any `Condvar::wait` outside a `wait_while` call or a predicate loop? Any nested lock
    acquisition that breaks the documented lock order?
16. Any new atomic ordering with no comment that names the data it publishes? Any `Relaxed` on a
    publish/subscribe flag? [`memory-model`]
17. Any `unsafe` block with no `// SAFETY:` comment, or any `unsafe fn` with no `# Safety`
    section? [`rust-unsafe`]
18. Any FFI entry point that can panic instead of mapping a typed Rust error to an ABI-safe
    status, sentinel, out-parameter, or foreign exception? [`rust-panic-safety`,
    `ffi-error-progress-cancel`]
19. Any new `#[allow]` where `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` works? Any suppressed
    `clippy::correctness` or `clippy::suspicious` finding? [`rust-lints`] Any new `deny.toml`
    exception with no reason? [`rust-security`]

**Trait and type-system traps** (details in
[`type-and-trait-traps.md`](type-and-trait-traps.md),
[`trait-resolution.md`](trait-resolution.md), and
[`data-shape-traps.md`](data-shape-traps.md))

20. Any `impl Drop` on a struct where a field must be consumed? Move `Drop` onto a one-field guard
    that holds an `Option`. Use `ManuallyDrop` only when `size_of` proves a saving.
21. Any `fn(T) -> T` that takes a struct past the target's inline-copy boundary on a hot path?
    [`rust-hot-path`]
22. Any manual `PartialEq` next to a derived `Hash`, or two manual impls that normalize
    differently, on a `HashMap` or `HashSet` key? Any manual `PartialOrd` that does not return
    `Some(self.cmp(other))` on a type that also implements `Ord`?
23. Any `#[derive(Clone)]` on a struct that contains `Arc<T>` where the caller might expect an
    isolated copy?
24. Any `Deref` impl on a newtype that is not a smart pointer or a read-only `[T]` or `str`
    view of a collection newtype? Any `Deref` relied on to satisfy
    a trait bound or a `dyn Trait` coercion? Neither one walks the deref chain.
25. Any migration from `std::sync::Mutex` to `parking_lot` or `tokio::sync::Mutex` that relied
    on poison detection?
26. Any unchecked arithmetic on a value derived from untrusted input?
27. Any `Arc<T>` that points back to its parent container?
28. Any function that takes `&'a T` and also writes references into a storage parameter that
    shares the same `'a`? Split the lifetimes, or store owned data.
29. Any `impl<T: ...> PubTrait for T` on a public trait that is not sealed? Seal the trait, or
    write explicit per-type impls. The same blanket impl also makes every pointer-forwarding
    impl `E0119`, and blocks every later concrete impl on the same `Self` type.
30. Any foreign trait implemented for `Rc<Local>`, `Arc<Local>`, or `Vec<Local>`? Only `&T`,
    `&mut T`, `Box<T>`, and `Pin<P>` are `#[fundamental]`; the rest is `E0117`. Newtype the
    wrapper.
31. Any `Box::new([T; N])`, or any return of `[T; N]` by value, where the array is larger than
    16 KiB (`size_of::<[T; N]>()`)? Build it
    with `vec![x; n].into_boxed_slice()`, or collect an exact-length iterator into `Box<[T]>`.
32. Any extension-trait method whose name already exists on the type, or on a type in its deref
    chain? The shadowing is silent, and adding the method to a published trait breaks downstream
    builds with `E0034`.
33. Any `impl From<X> for Y` beside an `impl TryFrom<X> for Y`? The `core` blanket impl makes
    the pair `E0119`, and the choice between them is permanent.
