# Rust Discipline

Review rules for Rust API shape: `pub` and `pub(crate)` signatures, struct definitions, trait
bounds, and trait impls. Each rule targets a defect that compiles and then breaks a caller, a
downstream crate, or a later release. Apply them to every changed signature in the diff.

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Blocks the merge. The defect is silent, or it breaks downstream code and a release cannot undo it. |
| WARNING  | Fix it, or justify it in one line in the diff. |

## Verify

| Claim | Check | What a green result does not prove |
|-------|-------|------------------------------------|
| No lint regression | `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` | Clippy denies `derived_hash_with_manual_eq` by default. It does not see two manual `Hash` and `PartialEq` impls that disagree. |
| A public API change keeps SemVer | `cargo semver-checks check-release` on a published crate, if it is installed. Pass `--baseline-rev <rev>` for an unpublished one. | Version 0.50.0 (rustc 1.98.1) misses `&str` changed to `impl AsRef<str>`, a new blanket impl on a public trait, and a new provided method whose name can collide (E0034). Review those by hand. |
| A bound accepts every promised caller | A test that passes each caller shape the API promises. For a `for<'a>` bound, pass the function or method path itself. | Only the shapes the test passes. |
| A hash key keeps the `Eq`/`Hash` contract | A test that inserts through one form and looks up through the other | Only the forms the test uses. |

Update cargo-semver-checks with each stable rustc: it reads rustdoc JSON, whose format changes.
The `rust-crate-release` skill owns the bump decision from `cargo semver-checks` output.

## API design

### Accept borrowed args, not owned references

**Severity: WARNING**

Accept `&str`, `&[T]`, and `&Path` instead of `&String`, `&Vec<T>`, and `&PathBuf`: the owned
shapes force the caller to hold an allocation. Find violations with
`rg ':\s*&(String\b|Vec<|PathBuf\b)' --type rust -n`, and keep `&String` or `&Vec<T>` only for the
[two real exceptions](references/argument-shapes.md#when-string-and-vect-are-correct).

Take a generic `<P: AsRef<Path>>` only when call-site convenience matters more than one body per
type, and keep the body in a private concrete function. A published reference parameter that
becomes generic breaks every caller that coerces the function to a `fn(&T)` pointer (E0308) or
passes it to an `Fn(&T)` bound (`not general enough`). Read
[argument-shapes.md](references/argument-shapes.md) before you change a published shape.

Keep an iterator's extra reference out of a public bound. `items.iter().find(pred)` under
`F: Fn(&T) -> bool` fails with `E0277: expected an 'FnMut(&&T)' closure`. Do not widen the bound
to `Fn(&&T)`, which pins `&&T` into the API; re-borrow: `items.iter().find(|item| pred(item))`.

### Return a slice, not the container type

**Severity: WARNING**

A published `-> &mut Vec<T>` accessor pins `Vec`: a later switch to `Box<[T]>` breaks every
caller (E0599). Return `&[T]` or `&mut [T]`, and name each length-changing operation as a method
([example](references/api-conventions.md#return-a-slice-not-the-container-type)).

### Store a callback as `Box<dyn Fn>`, not `Box<dyn FnMut>`

**Severity: WARNING**

`impl Fn` in a field fails with `E0562`, and a `Vec<F>` cannot hold two closure types. Store
`Box<dyn Fn(..)>`. `Box<dyn FnMut(..)>` fails `publish(&self)` with `E0596`, and the `&mut self`
fix spreads to every caller and blocks sharing the owner behind an `Arc`. Put the mutation in the
callback's own `Cell` or `Mutex`. Clone captured data for the implicit `'static` bound; do
not store `Weak` callbacks, which die silently when the caller releases its `Arc`
([example](references/argument-shapes.md#store-a-callback-as-boxdyn-fn-not-boxdyn-fnmut)).

### Do not store `&'a mut H` in a struct field

**Severity: WARNING**

A `&'a mut H` field puts `'a` on the struct, on every holder, and on every signature that returns
it; removing it from a published type later breaks callers. Take a generic `H`, so an
owning caller (`Box<dyn Handler>`) names no lifetime, and add one forwarding impl per pointer the
caller may pass. Each one needs `+ ?Sized` (else `dyn Handler` fails with E0277) and the body
`H::handle(self, r)` (`self.handle(r)` overflows the stack). Read
[trait-resolution.md](references/trait-resolution.md#a-pointer-forwarding-impl-needs-sized-and-a-body-that-names-the-inner-impl)
before the trait ships. Find candidates with `rg "struct .+<'.+>\s*\{" --type rust -n`.

### Do not tie a callback argument to a named lifetime

**Severity: WARNING**

`F: Fn(&T) -> R` is already higher-ranked, so the callback cannot keep the reference: `E0521`
on a closure that stashes it shows the bound is correct. The defect is
`fn visit<'a, F: Fn(&'a T)>(..)`: it accepts a closure that stores the reference silently (1.99.1). Write `F: Fn(&T)`, or `for<'a>` where
the bound must name `'a`. For a callback that returns a borrow of its argument, write
`F: Fn(&T) -> &K` with `K: ?Sized`. Read
[argument-shapes.md](references/argument-shapes.md#callback-bounds-past-the-plain-borrow)
when you pick a callable bound or pass a method path to a `for<'a>` bound.

## Panics and error returns

This section is the catalog's home for the `unwrap` and `expect` rule.

- Use `.unwrap()` in tests and `examples/` only. Elsewhere, propagate with `?`.
- Use `.expect("<invariant>")` in non-test code only for a real invariant. The message states
  what must be true: `"config validated at startup"`. `"should never fail"` states a wish.
- State the lock-poisoning policy at every `lock()`. Write `.expect("<name> mutex poisoned")`
  when a panic under the lock must also stop the next user. Write
  `.unwrap_or_else(PoisonError::into_inner)` when the data stays valid after a panic mid-update.
  A bare `.lock().unwrap()` hides the choice. `parking_lot` and `tokio::sync` mutexes do not
  poison ([migration](references/ownership-and-concurrency-traps.md#parking_lot-and-tokio-mutexes-do-not-poison-on-panic)).
- Give `panic!`, `unreachable!`, and `todo!` a reason (`unreachable!("kind {kind:?} filtered
  earlier")`), and use them only for cases the code makes impossible.
- Return `Result` from a library path that can fail; never build control flow on a panic.
- Enforce the `unwrap` half with `clippy::unwrap_used` and `allow-unwrap-in-tests = true`. The
  `rust-lints` skill holds the rollout and the `#![expect]` that an `examples/` file needs.

The `rust-error-handling` skill owns the error type choice (`thiserror` or `anyhow`). Use one error
convention per dependency chain: one shared error type, or one enum per crate that the caller
translates, never both.

## Drop and RAII

- Prefer `std::os::fd::OwnedFd` and `std::os::windows::io::OwnedSocket` over a raw `i32` or
  `SOCKET`, which leaks on every error path that does not close it.
- Fields drop in declaration order, after `Drop::drop`. Document that order on a
  cleanup-critical type.
- `impl Drop` blocks every move of a non-`Copy` field out of the struct (E0509). Put `Drop` on a
  one-field guard, and keep the aggregate `Drop`-free. Make the guard's field an `Option` only
  when the cleanup consumes it.
- Use `core::mem::DropGuard` on Rust 1.100+, or a local `Drop` type, for cleanup. Under
  `panic = "abort"` no destructor runs after a panic.
- Never argue soundness from a guard's `Drop`. `mem::forget` is safe, so a caller can skip it.

## Match exhaustiveness

- **No `_ =>` wildcard on a crate-private enum.** A wildcard absorbs a new variant silently. List
  every arm, and join arms with identical handling as `A | B =>`. Enforce it with
  `#![warn(clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm)]` on the modules that match local enums, and put
  `#[expect(clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm, reason = "...")]` on a match of a foreign
  `#[non_exhaustive]` enum such as `io::ErrorKind`, where `_` is required.
- Mark a public enum that downstream code matches `#[non_exhaustive]` in its first release.
  Adding the attribute later is a breaking change.
- **A `downcast_ref` chain skips a new implementor silently.** For a closed set of types, use an
  enum, which fails with `E0004` instead. `if let` and `let else` stay fine for one variant.

## Locks and condition variables

- Write the lock order on the struct (`// Lock order: a -> b -> c`); every nested acquisition
  follows it.
- Measure contention before you switch to `parking_lot` or pick `RwLock` over `Mutex`.
- **Wait on a `Condvar` only through a predicate**: a bare `wait` blocks for ever when the
  notify arrives first. Call `cv.wait_while(guard, |n| *n == 0)`, with a predicate that reads only
  state that the same mutex protects.
- A blocking-lock guard held across `.await` makes the future `!Send` and can deadlock the
  executor; `clippy::await_holding_lock` finds it.

## Lint suppression

Reject a new `#[allow]` where `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` works, and any suppression of a
`clippy::correctness` or `clippy::suspicious` finding. The `rust-lints` skill owns the
suppression order and `clippy.toml`.
