# Android native debugging

Everything here needs a device or an emulator and the NDK. Work through it only after the
host reproduction in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) has failed, because every step costs more
than the same step on the host.

Contents: logcat filtering, tracing to logcat, `RUST_BACKTRACE` on a device, tombstones,
symbolication, device builds, LLDB via Android Studio.

## Logcat filtering

```bash
# Your own native tags (the tags that the bootstrap passes to the logcat sink)
adb logcat -s my-native-tag:V my-other-native-tag:V

# The crash buffer: the native crash dump, no root needed
adb logcat -b crash

# Panic records and fatal signals, regardless of tag
adb logcat | grep -E "rust_panic|Abort message|SIGABRT|SIGSEGV|SIGBUS"

# Native crash and Java runtime channels.
# Quote the specifiers: an unquoted "*" is a glob in the shell.
adb logcat -s 'AndroidRuntime:E' 'DEBUG:*' 'libc:*'
```

An app process sends stdout and stderr to `/dev/null`. `println!`, `dbg!`, and the default
panic hook print nothing to logcat. Until a logcat sink is wired, the crash channels give a
signal and an address, not a panic record.

## Route tracing to logcat

In the bootstrap `cdylib`, call `tracing::subscriber::set_global_default`, then
`tracing_log::LogTracer::init()`. Do not call `android_logger::init_once`,
`SubscriberInitExt::init()` or `try_init()`, or the `fmt` builder's `init()` there. A process
holds one `log` logger: the extra call fails, and `init()` panics. The `rust-observability`
skill, when it is installed, owns this sequence and its reasons (section *One dispatcher
install, multiple sinks*).

A shipped build sends the redacted record to the platform sink. `tracing-logcat` writes the full
rendered event, the message and the field values included. Add it only in a debug or opt-in
build.

Prove the wiring on a device: one `log::info!` from a dependency and one `tracing::info!` must
both reach logcat, and the init path must return success.

For a run-time level override, build the filter on `tracing_subscriber::reload::Layer`. It is
the supported way to change a filter after the subscriber is global. Export a set function and a
clear function from the bootstrap, so you can raise one scope without a rebuild. A raised level
reaches `log` records only because `LogTracer::init()` set `log::max_level()` to `Trace`.

A ring-buffer layer next to the logcat layer lets the app attach the last N events to a bug
report. It gets logs from a user who cannot run `adb`. Apply the redaction rules of the
`rust-observability` skill to every event that it keeps.

## RUST_BACKTRACE on Android

`RUST_BACKTRACE` is **not inherited** by an Android app process. Setting it in your shell, in
Gradle, or in the run configuration does nothing.

1. In an app, use the bootstrap's redacted panic record (the `rust-panic-safety` skill) and the
   symbolicated tombstone. Capture a full backtrace only in a local diagnostic build whose
   output does not enter telemetry.
2. For a standalone test binary pushed to the device, the environment works:

   ```bash
   cargo test --locked --no-run --target aarch64-linux-android -p my-crate
   # Push the path that the "Executable ... (<path>)" line prints; it is under deps/ with a hash
   adb push <executable-path> /data/local/tmp/my_test
   adb shell "cd /data/local/tmp && chmod +x my_test && RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./my_test"
   ```

   The path moves with `build.build-dir`. In a script, read the `executable` field of
   `cargo test --no-run --message-format=json`.

## Tombstones

```bash
# All tombstones, with the rest of the system state, in one archive
adb bugreport bugreport.zip

# On a rooted or userdebug device you can also read them directly
adb shell ls -lt /data/tombstones/ | head -5
adb pull /data/tombstones/tombstone_00
```

Read a tombstone in this order:

1. `signal` line. 6 (SIGABRT) is an abort, including a panic that hit an unguarded export.
   11 (SIGSEGV) is a memory fault. 7 (SIGBUS) is usually misalignment.
2. `Abort message` line. It is present only when the aborting code set it: Rust
   `panic = "abort"` (Rust copies a `&str` or `String` panic payload into it) or a bionic fatal
   error. Treat it as sensitive. With `panic = "unwind"`, a panic that reaches an unguarded
   export aborts with no `Abort message`; look for `core::panicking::panic_cannot_unwind` in the
   symbolicated backtrace.
3. `backtrace:` block. Find the first frame whose path ends in your `.so`, for example
   `#03 pc 0000000000012345  /data/app/.../lib/arm64/libmy_ffi.so (BuildId: 1a2b...)`. The `pc`
   value is the offset inside that library; feed it to `llvm-addr2line`. Keep the `BuildId`.
   A library that loads straight from the APK shows as `base.apk!libmy_ffi.so (offset 0x...)`;
   the `pc` value is still relative to the library.

## Symbolicate

```bash
# The NDK addr2line. The command substitution expands the host glob;
# a plain assignment keeps the "*" literal.
ADDR2LINE=$(echo "$ANDROID_NDK_HOME"/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/*/bin/llvm-addr2line)

# -C demangles (v0 too), -f prints the function, -i expands inlined frames, -e names the binary
$ADDR2LINE -Cfie target/aarch64-linux-android/<ship-profile>/libmy_ffi.so 0x12345 0x67890

# Or symbolicate a whole tombstone or logcat capture
"$ANDROID_NDK_HOME"/ndk-stack -sym target/aarch64-linux-android/<ship-profile> -dump tombstone_00
```

`<ship-profile>` is the profile that built the library Gradle packaged, for example `android-jni`
in the `rust-android-build` skill. A `--release` build of the same crate is a different binary.

`ndk-stack` starts to parse at the `*** *** ***` line; keep that line when you copy a trace.

The `.so` must be the exact build that ran on the device, and it must not be stripped. Gradle
strips the packaged `.so`, so symbolicate against the Cargo output in
`target/<triple>/<ship-profile>/`, not against the copy from the APK. When the frame shows a
`BuildId`, compare it with the `Build ID` that `llvm-readelf -n libmy_ffi.so` prints. A mismatch
means a different binary, and every line it gives you is wrong. A Rust `cdylib` has no Build ID
unless the link adds `--build-id=sha1`; the `rust-android-build` skill owns that flag, stripping,
and symbol upload.

## Build for a device

```bash
cargo build --locked -p my-ffi --target aarch64-linux-android            # debug
cargo build --locked -p my-ffi --target aarch64-linux-android --profile <ship-profile>
```

## LLDB via Android Studio

1. Open the Android project in Android Studio.
2. Run > Edit Configurations > Debugger tab > Debug type: **Dual (Java + Native)**.
3. Add a symbol directory that points at the Cargo output for the device ABI, for example
   `target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/`.
4. Add the `command script import` line for `lldb_lookup.py` to the LLDB startup commands, so
   Rust values print as Rust. See [rust-gdb-pretty-printers.md](rust-gdb-pretty-printers.md).
5. Set breakpoints in the Rust source files and run with the debugger attached. Studio pushes
   and starts `lldb-server` on the device for you.

If breakpoints stay unresolved, the symbol directory is wrong or the packaged `.so` does not
match the one in it. Rebuild both from the same commit.
