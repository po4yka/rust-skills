## The one rule: `&T` is `Send` exactly when `T` is `Sync`

`Sync` states that one fact at the type level. A `Send` error whose `help:` line names `Sync`
(``the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `Cell<i32>` `` under ``note: required for `&Cell<i32>`
to implement `Send` ``) therefore does not ask for a `Send` impl. It reports a shared reference
to a value that is not shareable. Both auto traits are derived field-wise. Fix a bound error in
the fields, not with an impl. Probe a question with `fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}` and
`assert_send::<&Cell<i32>>();`.

Repair in this order. Delete the sharing and move the value instead of the reference. Or give the
pointee interior mutability that is `Sync`: an atomic, a `Mutex`, or an `RwLock`. Only then read
the `rust-unsafe` skill, and only for a type you own whose own invariant makes the impl sound.

Never add `unsafe impl Send` or `unsafe impl Sync` only to make an error in this skill go away,
including on a wrapper struct around an `Rc`, a `Cell`, or a guard. The compiler accepts the impl
whether or not it is sound. Fix the field, the lock, or the signature instead.

`cannot be sent` is a failed `Send` bound; `cannot be shared` is a failed `Sync` bound. The second
appears under an `Arc`, because `Arc<T>: Send` itself requires `T: Sync`.

## Verify the auto traits

The compiler proves only the auto traits it derives from fields. After a manual `unsafe impl`, it
no longer checks what a raw pointer field points to, so a green build proves nothing about that
impl.

| Claim | Check |
| --- | --- |
| A public type stays `Send` or `Sync` | A `const` assertion next to the type (below). A field edit then fails at the definition, not at a distant caller. Across releases, `cargo semver-checks` reports `auto_trait_impl_removed` |
| A public `-> impl Trait` return stays `Send` | Write `+ Send` (and `+ Sync` when callers share it) in the signature. See [Auto traits leak](#auto-traits-leak-out-of-impl-trait-and-async-fn) |
| A type is deliberately not `Send` | A `compile_fail` doctest that defines `assert_send` and calls `assert_send::<my_crate::Type>()`, and nothing else: it passes on any error, and stable rustdoc does not check an error code. A doctest is a separate crate, so `crate::Type` fails for the wrong reason |
| An `Arc` payload is shareable | `clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync`, warn by default |
| No `std::sync` guard lives across an `.await` | `clippy::await_holding_lock`, warn by default |
| Every `async fn` future is `Send` | `clippy::future_not_send` (nursery). Set `future_not_send = "warn"` under `[lints.clippy]` in a library whose futures cross `spawn`, and put `#[expect(clippy::future_not_send, reason = "...")]` on each future that is local by design. It proves nothing about a generic `async fn` |

Run `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` before a commit that touches a type or a
future that crosses threads.

```rust
pub struct Session { pub id: u32, pub buf: Vec<u8> }

const _: () = {
    const fn assert_send_sync<T: Send + Sync>() {}
    assert_send_sync::<Session>();
};
```

## The auto trait table

| Type | `Send` when | `Sync` when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T` (your struct) | every field is `Send` | every field is `Sync` |
| `&T` | `T: Sync` | `T: Sync` |
| `&mut T` | `T: Send` | `T: Sync` |
| `Box<T>` | `T: Send` | `T: Sync` |
| `Arc<T>` | `T: Send + Sync` | `T: Send + Sync` |
| `Rc<T>` | never | never |
| `*const T`, `*mut T` | never | never |
| `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>` | `T: Send` | never |
| `Mutex<T>`, `RwLock<T>` | `T: Send` | see [lock bounds](#lock-payload-bounds-mutex-and-rwlock-are-not-interchangeable) |
| `MutexGuard<'_, T>`, `RwLockReadGuard`, `RwLockWriteGuard` | never | `T: Sync` |

Two rows carry the surprise:

- **`Arc<T>` needs both traits on the payload.** An `Arc` clone hands a second owner shared
  access, so `Arc<Cell<i32>>` fails with `` `Cell<i32>` cannot be shared between threads safely ``
  and a `note:` that suggests `RwLock` or `AtomicI32`. Replace the `Cell`: `Arc<AtomicI32>`,
  `Arc<RwLock<i32>>`, and `Arc<Mutex<Cell<i32>>>` all work. Do not wrap the `Cell` in the
  suggested `RwLock`: `RwLock<Cell<i32>>` fails again. `clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync` reports
  such an `Arc::new` at the construction site; if that `Arc` never crosses a thread, use `Rc`.
- **`&mut T` is not the mirror of `&T`.** `&mut T: Send` requires `T: Send`, not `T: Sync`, because
  `std::mem::replace` moves the value out through it. `&mut Cell<i32>` is `Send`;
  `&mut Rc<i32>` is not.

## `unsafe impl Send` cannot target a reference (E0321)

`unsafe impl Send for &Handle {}` fails with `error[E0321]: cross-crate traits with a default impl,
like Send, can only be implemented for a struct/enum type`. `Sync` is the only lever that reaches
`&Handle`: `unsafe impl Sync for Handle {}` makes `&Handle` `Send` through the blanket impl. That
is a stronger promise, and the `rust-unsafe` skill holds the audit it needs.

## Lock payload bounds: `Mutex` and `RwLock` are not interchangeable

- `Mutex<T>: Sync` requires only `T: Send`.
- `RwLock<T>: Sync` requires `T: Send + Sync`.

Changing a read-heavy `Mutex<T>` to an `RwLock<T>` is therefore **not** a drop-in change. It stops
compiling as soon as the payload holds a `Cell` or a `RefCell`, and the error lands on the
`Arc<RwLock<...>>` at a call site far from the edit. Check the payload first. An `Rc` payload is
not a symptom of the swap: `Mutex<Rc<T>>` is neither `Send` nor `Sync` before the edit. The
`Send` direction gives no warning, because both locks are `Send` when `T: Send`.

## Guards: `MutexGuard` is not `Send`, and it is `Sync`

`std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, T>` is `!Send` for every `T`, because the unlock must run on the
locking thread. The guard is `Sync` whenever `T: Sync`, so `&MutexGuard<'_, T>` **is** `Send`.

- Give a worker `&guard` only when the payload is `Sync`: `&MutexGuard<'_, Cell<T>>` does not
  cross. Clone the value out of the guard instead. Never give a worker the guard itself.
- Pass `&guard` through `thread::scope`. `thread::spawn` requires `'static`, so it rejects the
  borrow with ``error[E0597]: `lock` does not live long enough``, plus `error[E0373]` when the
  closure borrows `guard` directly. Do not apply the E0373 `move` suggestion: it moves the guard
  itself, and that fails with E0277.
- Do not hold a `std::sync` guard across an `.await`. The task can resume on another thread, so
  the future stops being `Send`. `clippy::await_holding_lock` catches it.

## `PhantomData` surgery

`PhantomData<X>` inherits the auto traits of `X`. Use `PhantomData<Cell<()>>` to remove only
`Sync`. Use a raw pointer marker such as `PhantomData<*mut ()>` only when you mean to remove both,
because it also blocks a move to a worker thread. Write `()` in the marker, not your own `T`: a
marker that names `T` also changes variance. Read
[references/phantomdata-markers.md](references/phantomdata-markers.md) when you design a marker:
it has the auto-trait marker table, and the marker that removes only `Send`.

## Auto traits leak out of `impl Trait` and `async fn`

A public `-> impl Trait` with no explicit `+ Send` publishes whatever auto traits the **body**
happens to have. Adding one `Rc` inside the function is then a breaking change, reported at every
distant call site with a `note: required because it appears within the type impl Iterator<Item =
u32>` that points into your private body. Spell the bound in the signature
(`fn ids() -> impl Iterator<Item = u32> + Send`): the guarantee is frozen, and the same body
fails at the definition. Write `+ Send` only when you intend it, and add `+ Sync` when callers
share the value. Record a single-threaded-by-design decision in the doc comment.

`async fn f() -> T` desugars to `fn f() -> impl Future<Output = T>` and has the same leak. On
stable Rust 1.99.1, no syntax bounds an `async fn` return type, so write the desugared form:
`fn load(id: u32) -> impl Future<Output = u32> + Send { async move { id + 1 } }`. Do not silence
the `async_fn_in_trait` warning when callers spawn the future; the `rust-async-internals` skill,
when it is installed, covers `async fn` in a trait.

The async diagnostic, `error: future cannot be sent between threads safely`, has **no error
code**, so a search for E0277 finds nothing. Its `note: future is not Send as this value is used
across an await` names the value and the `.await` that traps it. Read
[references/rustc-transcripts.md](references/rustc-transcripts.md) for both transcripts.
