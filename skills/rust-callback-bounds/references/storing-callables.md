# Storing callables and shaping generic parameters

Deep material for `SKILL.md`. Every diagnostic, size, and allocation count comes from rustc
1.97.0, edition 2024, on aarch64-apple-darwin.

## A custom trait supplies no closure-signature expectation

`SKILL.md` states the rule. This is the worked example. The bound is higher-ranked and it lives on
a user trait, not on `Fn*`, so no closure form is accepted. A named `fn` item is:

```rust
trait FnOutput<In> { type Output; fn call(&mut self, i: In) -> Self::Output; }
impl<F, In, Out> FnOutput<In> for F where F: FnMut(In) -> Out {
    type Output = Out;
    fn call(&mut self, i: In) -> Out { self(i) }
}
struct Order { country: String }

fn sort_by_key<T, F>(arr: &mut [T], mut key: F)
where
    for<'a> F: FnOutput<&'a T>,
    for<'a> <F as FnOutput<&'a T>>::Output: Ord,
{
    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        for j in (i + 1)..arr.len() {
            if key.call(&arr[j]) < key.call(&arr[i]) { arr.swap(i, j); }
        }
    }
}

// Accepted: a `fn` item's lifetimes are late bound at declaration, so the
// item type is already higher-ranked.
fn country(x: &Order) -> &str { &x.country }
fn ok(orders: &mut [Order]) { sort_by_key(orders, country); }
```

Three closure forms against that same bound, three failures:

```text
// sort_by_key(orders, |o| &o.country)
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
   |                          ^   - type must be known at this point
   = help: consider giving this closure parameter an explicit type

// sort_by_key(orders, |o: &Order| &o.country)
error: lifetime may not live long enough
   |         -     - ^^^^^^^^^^ returning this value requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`

// sort_by_key(orders, |o: &Order| -> &str { &o.country })
error: lifetime may not live long enough
   |         -          -      ^^^^^^^^^^ returning this value requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`
```

Annotating the return type does not help. Wrap the closure in `hrtb_ref(..)` from `SKILL.md`, or
pass a named `fn`.

## Arc and Rc of `dyn Fn` do not implement `Fn`

`std` ships `impl<F: Fn + ?Sized> Fn for &F` and the same for `Box<F>`. It ships nothing for `Rc`
or `Arc`. A shared callback stored as `Arc<dyn Fn(..)>` for cheap cloning therefore satisfies no
`F: Fn(..)` bound:

```rust,compile_fail
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;

fn takes<F: Fn()>(_f: F) {}

fn main() {
    let b: Box<dyn Fn()> = Box::new(|| {});
    takes(b);                             // ok
    let r: &dyn Fn() = &|| {};
    takes(r);                             // ok

    let a: Arc<dyn Fn()> = Arc::new(|| {});
    takes(a);                             // E0277
    let c: Rc<dyn Fn()> = Rc::new(|| {});
    takes(c);                             // E0277
}
```

```text
error[E0277]: expected a `Fn()` closure, found `Arc<dyn Fn()>`
13 |     takes(a);
   |     ----- ^ expected an `Fn()` closure, found `Arc<dyn Fn()>`
   = help: the trait `Fn()` is not implemented for `Arc<dyn Fn()>`
   = note: wrap the `Arc<dyn Fn()>` in a closure with no arguments: `|| { /* code */ }`
```

Two repairs. Take `Arc<dyn Fn(..)>` in the signature and call it directly, which is the honest
form for a shared callback. Or follow the `note:` and wrap: `takes(move || a())`.

## `Box<dyn Fn>` allocates for a non-zero-sized closure value

A non-capturing closure is a ZST. A closure that captures only a zero-sized
value can also be a ZST. `Box` of either value does not call the allocator; it
stores a dangling, well-aligned pointer. Measure the value size, not whether a
capture exists:

```rust
use std::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout, System};
use std::mem::{size_of, size_of_val};
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

static ALLOCS: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

struct Counting;
unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for Counting {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, l: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
        ALLOCS.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
        unsafe { System.alloc(l) }
    }
    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, p: *mut u8, l: Layout) { unsafe { System.dealloc(p, l) } }
}

#[global_allocator]
static A: Counting = Counting;

fn main() {
    let before = ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let f: Box<dyn Fn()> = Box::new(|| {});
    assert_eq!(ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed) - before, 0);   // 0 allocations

    struct Marker;
    let marker = Marker;
    let zst_capture = move || { let _ = &marker; };
    assert_eq!(size_of_val(&zst_capture), 0);
    let mark = ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let z: Box<dyn Fn()> = Box::new(zst_capture);
    assert_eq!(ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed) - mark, 0);     // 0 allocations

    let s = String::from("x");
    let mark = ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let g: Box<dyn Fn()> = Box::new(move || { let _ = &s; });
    assert_eq!(ALLOCS.load(Ordering::Relaxed) - mark, 1);     // 1 allocation

    f();
    z();
    g();
    assert_eq!(size_of::<Box<dyn Fn()>>(), 16);
}
```

The concrete closure size decides whether `Box` allocates. Capturing a non-ZST
usually makes the closure non-zero-sized, but capture presence alone does not.
The residual cost of a boxed ZST callback is 16 bytes inline and one indirect
call.

## By-value `impl Trait` plus a delegating impl is a monomorphization bomb

`rust-discipline` recommends the delegating impl `impl<H: Handler + ?Sized> Handler for &mut H`
to stop a `&mut` field from infecting every signature with a lifetime. That recommendation is
correct. It becomes a trap the moment a trait method takes the same trait **by value** and the
body re-borrows into a recursive call: each level adds one `&mut`, and on a self-recursive data
type the chain never terminates.

`std::io::Write` already carries such a delegating impl, so this reproduces with no custom trait.
The fence says `ignore` because the harness runs `cargo check`, which accepts this block; the
failure arrives at monomorphization, as the note under it shows:

```rust,ignore
use std::io::{Result, Write};

struct Tree { tag: u8, kids: Vec<Tree> }

trait Serialize { fn ser(&self, out: impl Write) -> Result<()>; }

impl Serialize for Tree {
    fn ser(&self, mut out: impl Write) -> Result<()> {
        out.write_all(&[self.tag])?;
        for k in &self.kids { k.ser(&mut out)?; }   // &mut &mut &mut ...
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let t = Tree { tag: 1, kids: vec![Tree { tag: 2, kids: vec![] }] };
    t.ser(Vec::new()).unwrap();
}
```

`cargo check` on this exits 0. `cargo build` fails:

```text
error: reached the recursion limit while instantiating `<Tree as Serialize>::ser::<&mut &mut &mut &mut &mut &mut &mut ...>`
10 |         for k in &self.kids { k.ser(&mut out)?; }
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: the full name for the type has been written to '<crate>.long-type-<hash>.txt'
```

Two consequences for CI. First, a `cargo check`-only gate is blind to this class of failure, and
so is `cargo clippy`; both stop before monomorphization. Run `cargo build` or `cargo test` on the
same crate. Second, when the message is
`error[E0275]: overflow evaluating the requirement ...` with a `help: consider increasing the
recursion limit`, do not raise `#![recursion_limit]`. The chain is unbounded and a higher limit
only moves the failure.

Take the writer by reference instead. Then the type is fixed at every level:

```rust
use std::io::{Result, Write};

struct Tree { tag: u8, kids: Vec<Tree> }

trait Serialize { fn ser(&self, out: &mut impl Write) -> Result<()>; }

impl Serialize for Tree {
    fn ser(&self, out: &mut impl Write) -> Result<()> {
        out.write_all(&[self.tag])?;
        for k in &self.kids { k.ser(out)?; }
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let t = Tree { tag: 1, kids: vec![Tree { tag: 2, kids: vec![] }] };
    t.ser(&mut Vec::new()).unwrap();
}
```

`&mut impl Write` is not a drop-in replacement, because `impl Trait` carries an implicit `Sized`
bound. A caller holding a `&mut dyn Write` is rejected:

```text
error[E0277]: the size for values of type `dyn std::io::Write` cannot be known at compilation time
9 |     a(d2);
  |     - ^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
note: required by an implicit `Sized` bound in `a`
2 | fn a(_: &mut impl Write) {}
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^ required by the implicit `Sized` requirement on this type parameter in `a`
help: consider relaxing the implicit `Sized` restriction
2 | fn a(_: &mut impl Write + ?Sized) {}
  |                         ++++++++
```

Write `&mut (impl Write + ?Sized)`, or `fn f<W: Write + ?Sized>(out: &mut W)`. Both accept
`&mut dyn Write`.

## `impl Trait` in argument position is not a named generic parameter

They are semantically identical and syntactically distinct in two places that break callers.

A caller cannot turbofish an `impl Trait` parameter, because the function declares zero generic
parameters:

```rust,compile_fail
use std::io::Write;
fn a(_: impl Write) {}
fn b<W: Write>(_: W) {}

fn main() {
    b::<Vec<u8>>(Vec::new());   // ok
    a::<Vec<u8>>(Vec::new());   // error
}
```

```text
error[E0107]: function takes 0 generic arguments but 1 generic argument was supplied
6 |     a::<Vec<u8>>(Vec::new());
  |     ^----------- help: remove the unnecessary generics
note: function defined here, with 0 generic parameters
  = note: `impl Trait` cannot be explicitly specified as a generic argument
```

Declare `fn f<W: Trait>(w: W)` whenever a caller may need to pin the type: inference ambiguity, a
`Default::default()` argument, or an empty collection literal.

In a trait, the impl must repeat the declaration's spelling:

```rust,compile_fail
pub trait Ser { fn ser(&self, out: impl std::io::Write); }
impl Ser for u8 { fn ser<W: std::io::Write>(&self, _out: W) {} }
```

```text
error[E0643]: method `ser` has incompatible signature for trait
1 | pub trait Ser { fn ser(&self, out: impl std::io::Write); }
  |                                    ------------------- declaration in trait here
2 | impl Ser for u8 { fn ser<W: std::io::Write>(&self, _out: W) {} }
  |                          ^ expected `impl Trait`, found generic parameter
help: try removing the generic parameter and using `impl Trait` instead
```

The mirror image, an `impl Trait` in the impl against a `<W: Trait>` declaration, is the same
E0643 with `expected generic parameter, found impl Trait`. Switching a published trait method
between the two forms breaks every implementor, even though the two signatures mean the same
thing. Pick one at publication and keep it.

Two more consequences of `impl Trait` in a trait method's argument position: it is a hidden
generic parameter, so it makes the trait not dyn-compatible, and a method *declaration* cannot
bind it as `mut` — `fn ser(&self, mut out: impl Write);` fails with
`patterns aren't allowed in functions without bodies`. The `mut` goes on the impl only.

## Unstable escape hatches for a callable field

Do not plan a stable API around either of these. Both are nightly-gated on 1.97.0:

```rust,compile_fail
trait DropBehavior { type OnDrop: FnOnce(u32); }
struct NotUsed;
impl DropBehavior for NotUsed {
    type OnDrop = impl FnOnce(u32);
}
```

```text
error[E0658]: `impl Trait` in associated types is unstable
4 |     type OnDrop = impl FnOnce(u32);
  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = note: see issue #63063 for more information

error: unconstrained opaque type
  = note: `OnDrop` must be used in combination with a concrete type within the same impl
```

`std::mem::DropGuard` is also unstable, `error[E0658]: use of unstable library feature
'drop_guard'`, issue #144426. And `fn_traits` is nightly-gated, which is why no user type can
implement `FnOnce` on stable — and why the blanket-impl pattern in `SKILL.md` is coherent.

## Composite outputs: RPITIT

The shape `SKILL.md` names. The callback becomes a named unit struct, and the method returns
`impl Ord` captured over `'a`:

```rust
use std::cmp::Reverse;
struct Order { country: String, code: u32 }

trait KeyProjection<In> {
    fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a In) -> impl Ord + use<'a, Self, In> where Self: 'a;
}

struct Country;
impl KeyProjection<Order> for Country {
    // Repeat the opaque form. A concrete `Reverse<&'a String>` here warns.
    fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a Order) -> impl Ord + use<'a> where Self: 'a {
        Reverse(&i.country)
    }
}

fn sort_by_key<T>(arr: &mut [T], mut key: impl KeyProjection<T>) {
    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        for j in (i + 1)..arr.len() {
            if key.project(&arr[j]) < key.project(&arr[i]) { arr.swap(i, j); }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![
        Order { country: "at".into(), code: 1 },
        Order { country: "cz".into(), code: 3 },
    ];
    sort_by_key(&mut v, Country);
    assert_eq!(v[0].code, 3);   // Reverse => descending
}
```

## Composite outputs: GAT against a lifetime on the trait

Use a GAT when callers must name the output as an associated type. This version works with an
element type that itself borrows:

```rust
trait KeyProjection<In> {
    type Out<'a>: Ord where Self: 'a, In: 'a;
    fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a In) -> Self::Out<'a>;
}

struct Order<'s> { country: &'s str, code: u32 }

struct Country;
impl<'s> KeyProjection<Order<'s>> for Country {
    type Out<'a> = std::cmp::Reverse<&'a str> where Self: 'a, Order<'s>: 'a;
    fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a Order<'s>) -> Self::Out<'a> {
        std::cmp::Reverse(i.country)
    }
}

fn sort_by_key<T>(arr: &mut [T], mut key: impl KeyProjection<T>) {
    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        for j in (i + 1)..arr.len() {
            if key.project(&arr[j]) < key.project(&arr[i]) { arr.swap(i, j); }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("at");
    let mut v = vec![
        Order { country: &s, code: 1 },
        Order { country: "cz", code: 3 },
    ];
    sort_by_key(&mut v, Country);
    assert_eq!(v[0].code, 3);
}
```

Do not put the lifetime on the trait instead. `for<'a> K: KeyProjection<'a, T>` compiles while
`T` is `'static` and silently forces `T: 'static` on every call site. With `Order<'s>` the same
program fails:

```text
error[E0597]: `s1` does not live long enough
17 |     let mut v = vec![Order { country: &s1, code: 1 }, ...];
   |                                       ^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
18 |     sort_by_key(&mut v, Country);
   |     ---------------------------- argument requires that `s1` is borrowed for `'static`
note: due to a current limitation of the type system, this implies a `'static` lifetime
 8 | fn sort_by_key<T, K>(arr: &mut [T], mut key: K) where for<'a> K: KeyProjection<'a, T> {
   |                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

A GAT and a lifetime parameter on the trait are not interchangeable. Use the GAT.

## Repeat the opaque return type in an RPITIT impl

Writing the concrete type in the impl is a public refinement of the trait's contract, and the
on-by-default `refining_impl_trait` lint says so:

```text
warning: impl trait in impl method signature does not match trait method signature
 5 |     fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a In) -> impl Ord + use<'a, Self, In> where Self: 'a;
   |                                             ---------------------------- return type from trait method defined here
10 |     fn project<'a>(&mut self, i: &'a Order) -> Reverse<&'a String> where Self: 'a {
   |                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: add `#[allow(refining_impl_trait)]` if it is intended for this to be part of the public API of this crate
   = note: `#[warn(refining_impl_trait_internal)]` (part of `#[warn(refining_impl_trait)]`) on by default
```

Repeat `impl Ord + use<'a>` in the impl and the warning disappears. Do not silence it with
`#[allow]` unless the concrete type really is part of your published API.
