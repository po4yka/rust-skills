# Ordering patterns

Worked examples for the `memory-model` skill: one example per common ordering
pattern, and the compare-exchange and `update` loop rules. Read only the section that
matches the task.

## Pattern 1: counter or unique id (Relaxed)

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};

static NEXT_ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

// Hand out a unique id. No other memory is published with it.
fn next_id() -> u64 {
    NEXT_ID.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed)
}
```

`fetch_add` with `Relaxed` is still atomic, so every increment is counted. Only
the order against other memory is dropped. The counter stops being `Relaxed`
when the reader uses it to index a buffer that the writer filled: that buffer is
dependent data.

## Pattern 2: publish/subscribe (Release store, Acquire load)

One thread writes data, then stores a flag. The other thread loads the flag,
then reads the data. The `Release`/`Acquire` pair creates the happens-before
edge that makes the data visible.

```rust,run
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU64, Ordering};
use std::thread;

static DATA: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
static READY: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

fn main() {
    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|| {
            // Publisher: every write the reader needs comes before the Release store.
            DATA.store(42, Ordering::Relaxed);
            READY.store(true, Ordering::Release);
        });
        s.spawn(|| {
            // Subscriber: the Acquire load that reads `true` makes DATA == 42 visible.
            while !READY.load(Ordering::Acquire) {
                std::hint::spin_loop();
            }
            assert_eq!(DATA.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 42);
        });
    });
}
```

- Put every published write before the `Release` store. A write after the
  store is not published.
- Put every dependent read after the `Acquire` load. A read before the load is
  not covered.
- Call `std::hint::spin_loop()` in a busy-wait. It is a CPU hint, not a yield
  to the scheduler. Block on a channel, a `Condvar`, or `thread::park` when the
  wait is not short and bounded.

## Pattern 3: stop flag and progress counter

A stop flag that only ends a loop can be `Relaxed`. The worker can see the flag
a few iterations late, and loop teardown accepts that delay. Use
`Release`/`Acquire` as soon as the signaller writes state that the worker reads
after it stops, such as a reason or a new configuration. In review, ask for
`Release`/`Acquire` unless a comment states that the flag publishes nothing.
The dependency is easy to add later and easy to miss.

A polled progress counter follows the same rule: `Relaxed` when the reader only
displays the number, `Release`/`Acquire` when the reader then reads the state
that the number refers to. A progress callback or a channel needs no ordering
choice. The `ffi-error-progress-cancel` skill, when it is
installed, covers cancellation and progress across a foreign function interface.

## Pattern 4: reference counting

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

// Increment: no data is published, and the object is already alive.
count.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);

// Decrement: AcqRel, so the thread that observes zero also observes every
// write made by every other owner before it dropped its reference.
if count.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::AcqRel) == 1 {
    // This thread holds the last reference. Destroy the object here.
}
```

The destructor reads the object, so the decrement must acquire the writes of
all other owners. std `Arc` uses a `Release` decrement and a `fence(Acquire)` on
the zero path. Both forms are correct.

## Compare-exchange and update loops

```rust,run
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

fn main() {
    let val = AtomicUsize::new(0);

    // Strong CAS: one attempt, no spurious failure. The failure ordering is
    // chosen independently of the success ordering (Rust 1.64 and later).
    assert_eq!(val.compare_exchange(0, 1, Ordering::Relaxed, Ordering::Acquire), Ok(0));

    // Weak CAS: it can fail spuriously, so use it only in a loop that feeds the
    // observed value back into the next attempt.
    let mut current = val.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    loop {
        match val.compare_exchange_weak(current, current + 1, Ordering::AcqRel, Ordering::Relaxed) {
            Ok(_) => break,
            Err(actual) => current = actual,
        }
    }

    // `update` (1.95+) writes that loop and returns the previous value.
    assert_eq!(val.update(Ordering::AcqRel, Ordering::Relaxed, |v| v + 1), 2);

    // `try_update` (1.95+) stops without a write when the closure returns None.
    assert_eq!(val.try_update(Ordering::AcqRel, Ordering::Relaxed, |v| v.checked_sub(10)), Err(3));
    assert_eq!(val.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 3);
}
```

- **Failure ordering.** It can be `Relaxed`, `Acquire`, or `SeqCst`. `Release`
  and `AcqRel` are invalid, because a failed exchange writes nothing. Since Rust
  1.64 the failure ordering can be stronger than the success ordering. Do not
  weaken a failure ordering only to match the success ordering.
- **Choose each ordering for its own path.** The success ordering covers what
  the winner publishes or consumes. The failure ordering covers what the loser
  reads next. `Relaxed` on failure is correct when the loser only retries.
- **Weak or strong.** Use `compare_exchange_weak` only inside a retry loop.
  Read
  [platform-memory-models.md](platform-memory-models.md#platform-memory-models)
  when you choose between the weak and strong form on an LL/SC target or in a
  hot loop.
- **`fetch_update` is being renamed.** Use `update` (the closure always returns
  a value) or `try_update` (the closure returns `Option`). Both are stable since
  1.95. `try_update` has the same arguments and result as `fetch_update`, so
  rename the call. The std source marks `fetch_update` deprecated since 1.99.0:
  on 1.98 only the allow-by-default `deprecated_in_future` lint reports it, and
  Rust 1.99 (due 2026-10-01) makes it a `deprecated` warning that fails a
  `-D warnings` gate. Keep `fetch_update` only while `rust-version` is below
  1.95.
