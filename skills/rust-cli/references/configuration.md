# Configuration sources and precedence

Deep material for [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Read it when you add a configuration source, a list
setting, or an environment variable. The trust rule for project configuration stays in SKILL.md.

## Precedence

Define one precedence order and use it for every setting. A common order is:

```text
built-in default < system config < user config < project config < environment < CLI
```

Use the order required by the product. Do not add every source automatically.
Merge typed partial values, not serialized documents. Preserve the difference
between absent, explicit `false`, explicit zero, and an empty list.

For each setting, define whether a higher source replaces or extends a list.
Replacement is the safe default. If lists extend, define the order and a way to
clear inherited values.

## Source rules

- Treat an explicit `--config PATH` that does not exist as an error.
- Ignore a missing auto-discovered optional file.
- Report a present file that cannot be read or parsed.
- Resolve relative paths inside a config file from that file's directory unless
  the documented format says they use the process working directory.
- Parse environment values with the same range and enum validation as CLI values.
- Report an invalid present environment value. Do not silently use a default.
- Provide explicit negative flags such as `--no-color` when a boolean can come
  from lower-precedence sources.
- Record source provenance internally so diagnostics can name the winning value.
- Do not print secret values in effective-configuration output.

Read configuration before starting irreversible work. Validate the complete
effective configuration once. Do not let separate subsystems reinterpret the
same variable with different defaults.
