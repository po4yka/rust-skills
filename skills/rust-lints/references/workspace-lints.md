# `[workspace.lints]` templates

- [Strict template](#strict-template): the target for a new workspace.
- [Notes on the strict template](#notes-on-the-strict-template)
- [Pragmatic baseline](#pragmatic-baseline-for-an-existing-workspace): the start for an
  existing workspace with a backlog.

Both tables belong in the workspace root manifest. Every member inherits them with
`[lints] workspace = true`.

## Strict template

Start here for a new workspace. For an existing workspace with a large backlog, start from the
[pragmatic baseline](#pragmatic-baseline-for-an-existing-workspace) and climb.

## Notes on the strict template

- Under `-D warnings`, `warn` and `deny` both fail the gate. `deny` also stops a local
  `cargo build`, so it suits lints that are never acceptable, even for a moment.
- `clippy::string_to_string` was deprecated in clippy 1.91; `implicit_clone` covers it. Clippy
  0.1.98 reports `lint clippy::string_to_string has been removed`. Do not re-add it.
- Add the async lints only when the workspace runs an async runtime, and the pointer and FFI
  lints only when it contains `unsafe` pointer work. Both blocks are in
  [lint-catalog.md](lint-catalog.md).
- `unconditional_recursion` is warn-by-default, so the strict template must
  promote it. An inherent method that carries a trait method's name resolves
  first, so `fn into_iter(self) -> Owned { self.into_iter() }` inside
  `impl IntoIterator` calls the inherent method and passes review. Delete that
  inherent method in a later cleanup and the same body calls itself. rustc
  still only warns and the binary links. A debug build then dies with `fatal
  runtime error: stack overflow, aborting` and exit code 134 (1.98.1). A release build
  is worse: LLVM turns the tail call into an infinite loop, so the process
  hangs with no diagnostic at all.
- Most of the performance lints above are not in the `perf` group;
  [lint-catalog.md](lint-catalog.md#clippy-lint-groups) gives the group of each.

## Pragmatic baseline for an existing workspace

An existing workspace with thousands of files cannot land the strict set in one
commit. Use group levels first, then cherry-pick the pedantic lints that pay
for themselves:

```toml
[workspace.lints.clippy]
correctness = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }   # almost certainly a bug
suspicious  = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }   # very likely wrong
style       = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
complexity  = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
perf        = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }

# Cherry-picked pedantic lints - cheap to fix, high hit rate.
cloned_instead_of_copied            = "warn"
explicit_iter_loop                  = "warn"
explicit_into_iter_loop             = "warn"
implicit_clone                      = "warn"
inefficient_to_string               = "warn"
map_unwrap_or                       = "warn"
redundant_closure_for_method_calls  = "warn"
semicolon_if_nothing_returned       = "warn"
uninlined_format_args               = "warn"
unnested_or_patterns                = "warn"
manual_let_else                     = "warn"
trivially_copy_pass_by_ref          = "warn"
unused_self                         = "warn"
default_trait_access                = "warn"
match_wildcard_for_single_variants  = "warn"
should_panic_without_expect         = "warn"   # pin the expected panic message
ignore_without_reason               = "warn"   # #[ignore = "why"]

[workspace.lints.rust]
unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn = "deny"
```

This baseline is a starting point, not a destination. Record which strict lints
are still off and why. Then follow [Add or tighten a lint](../SKILL.md#add-or-tighten-a-lint).
