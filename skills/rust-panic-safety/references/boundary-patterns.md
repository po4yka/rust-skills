# Boundary guard patterns

Every pattern here answers the same question: where does the panic stop, and what does the
foreign caller see instead. Pick the shape that matches the boundary, then keep it identical
across all entry points of the crate.

Every `Err(payload)` branch below calls this helper. Dropping a caught payload can panic:

```rust,run
fn discard_panic_payload(payload: Box<dyn std::any::Any + Send>) {
    let second = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| drop(payload)));
    if let Err(payload) = second {
        std::mem::forget(payload);
    }
}

struct PanicOnDrop;

impl Drop for PanicOnDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        panic!("panic payload destructor");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let hook = std::panic::take_hook();
    std::panic::set_hook(Box::new(|_| {}));
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        std::panic::panic_any(PanicOnDrop);
    });
    let payload = match result {
        Err(payload) => payload,
        Ok(()) => unreachable!(),
    };
    discard_panic_payload(payload);
    std::panic::set_hook(hook);
}
```

Do not format or inspect the payload. The `forget` is a bounded fallback for the double-panic
path, where safe destruction is no longer available.

## Pattern selection

| Boundary shape | Guard | Panic result the caller sees |
|---|---|---|
| C ABI, returns a scalar | `catch_unwind` in the `extern` body | A reserved negative status code |
| C ABI, returns a pointer or handle | `catch_unwind` in the `extern` body | Null, plus a last-error slot |
| C ABI, writes through out-params | `catch_unwind` in the `extern` body | A status code; out-params untouched |
| JNI method | `with_env` + `resolve`, or `catch_unwind` | A thrown exception and a neutral return value |
| UniFFI `#[uniffi::export]` | Generated scaffolding | The generated error path |
| Rust callback that foreign code invokes | `catch_unwind` in the callback body | A status code, or a recorded flag |
| Runtime entry that drives async work | `catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(...))` around `block_on` | A status code plus a join-point check |

## Status codes

Reserve a code for a caught panic. Never reuse a domain error code for a bug.

```rust
#[repr(i32)]
pub enum Status {
    Ok = 0,
    InvalidInput = -1,
    NotFound = -2,
    Io = -3,
    Busy = -4,
    Panic = -99,
}
```

Rules:

- Keep the numbers stable. A binding layer hard-codes them.
- Map the typed error to the code in one function, in one module.
- Install the privacy-safe panic hook before you return `Panic`. It records a closed site code
  plus numeric location. Never log or transfer the raw payload.

## Returning a pointer or an opaque handle

A constructor cannot return a status code and a pointer at the same time. Return null on
failure and expose the reason through a separate call.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(i32)]
enum LastError {
    None = 0,
    Domain = 1,
    Panic = 2,
}

thread_local! {
    static LAST_ERROR: std::cell::Cell<LastError> =
        const { std::cell::Cell::new(LastError::None) };
}

fn set_last_error(error: LastError) {
    LAST_ERROR.with(|slot| slot.set(error));
}

#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "C" fn lib_last_error_code() -> i32 {
    LAST_ERROR.with(|slot| slot.get() as i32)
}

#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "C" fn lib_session_new(config: *const std::os::raw::c_char) -> *mut Session {
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        // SAFETY: the caller guarantees `config` is a valid null-terminated C string.
        let config = unsafe { std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr(config) }
            .to_str()
            .map_err(|_| Error::InvalidInput)?;
        Session::new(config)
    });
    match result {
        Ok(Ok(session)) => Box::into_raw(Box::new(session)),
        Ok(Err(_)) => {
            set_last_error(LastError::Domain);
            std::ptr::null_mut()
        }
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            set_last_error(LastError::Panic);
            std::ptr::null_mut()
        }
    }
}
```

The matching destructor must also be guarded, because a `Drop` implementation deeper in the
tree can panic.

```rust
/// # Safety
/// `ptr` must come from `lib_session_new` and must not be used again after this call.
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn lib_session_free(ptr: *mut Session) {
    if ptr.is_null() {
        return;
    }
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        // SAFETY: the caller guarantees single ownership of a pointer from the constructor.
        drop(unsafe { Box::from_raw(ptr) });
    });
    if let Err(payload) = result {
        discard_panic_payload(payload);
    }
}
```

A destructor that panics twice — once in the value, once in the guard — still aborts. Keep
`Drop` implementations infallible; the guard is a backstop, not a licence.

## Out-parameters

Write the out-param only on the success path. A caller that sees a non-zero status must be
able to trust that its buffer is unchanged.

```rust
/// # Safety
/// `out_len` must be non-null and writable for one `usize`.
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn lib_measure(input: *const u8, len: usize, out_len: *mut usize) -> i32 {
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        // SAFETY: the caller guarantees `input` is valid for `len` bytes.
        let bytes = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(input, len) };
        measure(bytes)
    });
    match result {
        Ok(Ok(value)) => {
            // SAFETY: the caller guarantees `out_len` is writable.
            unsafe { out_len.write(value) };
            0
        }
        Ok(Err(_)) => -1,
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            -99
        }
    }
}
```

## Transferring a bounded panic category

Return a stable integer category such as `LastError::Panic`. Do not transfer the
panic payload as a string. Truncation does not make arbitrary text safe. The
privacy-safe hook records a closed site code and numeric location for diagnosis.
Use a local host repro or an offline crash artifact when you need a backtrace or
message.

## Callbacks that foreign code invokes

A Rust function pointer handed to a C or platform runtime is an FFI entry point. It needs the
same guard, and it usually cannot report an error, so it must record one.

```rust
extern "C" fn on_event(ctx: *mut std::ffi::c_void, code: i32) -> i32 {
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        // SAFETY: `ctx` is the pointer passed to the registration call and outlives it.
        let state = unsafe { &*(ctx as *const State) };
        state.handle(code)
    });
    match result {
        Ok(Ok(())) => 0,
        Ok(Err(_)) => -1,
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            // Latch the stable category so the next owning call can report it.
            CALLBACK_FAILURE.store(
                Status::Panic as i32,
                std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Release,
            );
            Status::Panic as i32
        }
    }
}
```

Rules:

- A callback that a foreign event loop calls must never unwind, even when the loop claims to
  tolerate errors.
- Do not attach the panic to the current call only. Latch it, and surface it at the next call
  the owner makes, so the failure is not lost.
- Latch only a stable category or status code. Discard the arbitrary panic payload.
- Keep the callback body short. Long work inside a foreign callback multiplies the ways a
  panic can start.

## The macro-generated `extern` layer

When a crate exports many entry points, generate the `extern` layer so no hand-written body
can drift from the pattern. A reviewer then checks one macro instead of forty functions.

```rust
macro_rules! ffi_entry {
    ($name:ident, ($($arg:ident: $arg_ty:ty),* $(,)?), $ret:ty, $entry:ident, $on_panic:expr) => {
        #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
        pub extern "C" fn $name($($arg: $arg_ty),*) -> $ret {
            match std::panic::catch_unwind(move || $entry($($arg),*)) {
                Ok(value) => value,
                Err(payload) => {
                    discard_panic_payload(payload);
                    $on_panic
                },
            }
        }
    };
}
```

Pass a fixed status code, null pointer, or other documented sentinel as
`$on_panic`. The macro discards the payload. The process-wide privacy-safe hook
records the bounded site information once.

Audit that nothing bypasses it:

```bash
# Every extern definition should come from the macro. Hand-written bodies are findings.
rg -n 'extern "(C|system)" fn' --type rust
```

## JNI: the full pattern

### Loader

```rust
static JVM: std::sync::OnceLock<JavaVM> = std::sync::OnceLock::new();

#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
#[allow(improper_ctypes_definitions)]
pub extern "system" fn JNI_OnLoad(vm: JavaVM, _reserved: *mut std::ffi::c_void) -> jint {
    let _ = JVM.set(vm);
    match std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        init_logging("app-native");
        install_panic_hook();
        JNI_VERSION
    }) {
        Ok(version) => version,
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            jni::sys::JNI_ERR
        }
    }
}
```

Store the VM handle before the guard. A later call needs it to attach a thread or to report a
failure, and a panic during init must not lose it.

### Method entry point without `with_env`

Use this when the workspace pins `jni` 0.21 or earlier, which has no `with_env`/`resolve`.

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "system" fn Java_com_example_app_NativeBridge_nativeStart(
    mut env: JNIEnv<'_>,
    _thiz: JObject,
    handle: jlong,
) -> jint {
    let outcome = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
        let session = SESSION_REGISTRY.lookup(handle)?;
        session.start()
    }));
    match outcome {
        Ok(Ok(())) => 0,
        Ok(Err(SessionError::InvalidHandle)) => {
            let _ = env.throw_new(
                "java/lang/IllegalStateException",
                "invalid native session handle",
            );
            -1
        }
        Ok(Err(_)) => {
            let _ = env.throw_new("java/lang/RuntimeException", "native operation failed");
            -1
        }
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            let _ = env.throw_new("java/lang/RuntimeException", "native operation panicked");
            -1
        }
    }
}
```

`SESSION_REGISTRY.lookup` treats the `jlong` as an opaque generational ID. It
decodes a non-zero slot and generation, locks the registry, checks both values,
and clones an `Arc<Session>` only after they match. It releases the lock before
`start`. `nativeDestroy` removes the entry and increments its generation before
the slot can be reused. A forged, zero, destroyed, or stale ID returns
`SessionError::InvalidHandle`; it is never cast to a pointer.

### Rules that hold for both variants

- Throw before you return. The JVM raises the pending exception when control returns to Java.
- Return a neutral value after a throw. Java never reads it.
- Never call another JNI function after `throw_new` except to return. Most JNI calls are
  invalid while an exception is pending.
- Do not invent a new Java exception class per panic class. One type keeps one catch site on
  the managed side.
- Keep the panic exception message fixed. Never copy the panic payload into it. The privacy-safe
  hook records only a closed site code plus bounded numeric location.
- Resolve every `jlong` session ID through a generational registry before use. Never cast a
  caller-provided integer to a pointer.
- A panic on a thread that Rust attached to the JVM must be caught on that thread. The
  attaching code is an entry point too.

## UniFFI

`uniffi::setup_scaffolding!()` with `#[uniffi::export]` generates the `extern "C"` glue and
its panic guard. Consequences:

- Generated scaffolding needs no hand-written guard. Confirm with
  `rg -n 'extern "C"' <crate>/src` that every hit is macro-generated.
- Any hand-rolled `extern "C"` in the same crate bypasses the generated guard and needs the
  full treatment.
- Model the failure as a typed error in the UDL or the proc-macro signature. A panic becomes
  an opaque internal error on the foreign side; a typed error keeps its variant.

See the `uniffi-boundary` skill for the type mapping and the `ffi-error-progress-cancel`
skill for the error, progress, and cancellation contract.

## Async work behind a synchronous boundary

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "C" fn lib_run_blocking(handle: *mut Session) -> i32 {
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
        // SAFETY: the caller owns `handle` for the duration of this call.
        let session = unsafe { &mut *handle };
        session.runtime.block_on(session.run())
    }));
    match result {
        Ok(Ok(())) => 0,
        Ok(Err(_)) => -1,
        Err(payload) => {
            discard_panic_payload(payload);
            -99
        }
    }
}
```

Two distinct failure paths exist here:

1. A panic in the future's own body unwinds through `block_on`, and `catch_unwind` sees it.
2. A panic in a spawned task does not. It surfaces as a `JoinError` at the join point, so the
   `run()` body must check every handle it keeps.

Both must reach the caller. A guard alone is not enough when the crate spawns.

## Testing the guard

- Add a hidden test-only entry point, or call the plain Rust `_entry` function from a test and
  assert on the status code.
- Force a panic through a test hook, then assert the status is the reserved panic code and the
  process is still alive.
- Run the guard tests under `panic = "unwind"`. Cargo ignores the `panic` key for the test
  profile by default, so this is the normal case.
- Add a debug-build assertion that the panic hook is installed before the first entry point
  does work.
- Fuzz the input decoder behind the boundary. A fuzz harness finds the panics that a guard
  would otherwise hide behind a status code. See the `rust-test-tools` skill.
