# Pinning proofs, projection macros, and review checklist

Deep material for `rust-pin-projection`. `SKILL.md` holds the triage table, the verifier, the
rules, and the four structural pinning obligations. This file holds the proofs behind them, the
macro details, and the review checklist. `SelfRef` is the type from the "Get a value pinned"
section of `SKILL.md`, and `Wrapper` is the type from its Obligation 1.

Measured on rustc 1.98.1, edition 2024, with pin-project 1.1.13 and pin-project-lite 0.2.17. The
Miri output comes from nightly 2026-05-15 with the default Stacked Borrows model. The allocation
id depends on the program and the Miri version; the shape does not.

## Moves that Pin does not stop

`Pin::new` and `Pin::get_mut` are both safe for an `Unpin` target, and `Pin<Ptr>` implements
`DerefMut` for one. Safe code moves the value out through any of them:

```rust,run
use std::mem;
use std::pin::Pin;

fn main() {
    let (mut a, mut b) = (String::from("a"), String::from("b"));
    // Both calls are safe, because String: Unpin.
    mem::swap(Pin::new(&mut a).get_mut(), Pin::new(&mut b).get_mut());
    assert_eq!((a.as_str(), b.as_str()), ("b", "a"));

    // `Pin<Ptr>` implements `DerefMut` for an `Unpin` target, so this is safe too.
    let mut c = 0u32;
    *Pin::new(&mut c) = 7;
    assert_eq!(c, 7);
}
```

`!Unpin` does not stop a move either. Every Rust type moves, `!Unpin` included, until the value
is pinned. This program has no `unsafe`, no error, and no warning:

```rust,run
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
use std::mem;

struct NotUnpin { x: u32, _p: PhantomPinned }

fn main() {
    let a = NotUnpin { x: 1, _p: PhantomPinned };
    let mut c = a;                                   // move by assignment
    let mut d = NotUnpin { x: 2, _p: PhantomPinned };
    mem::swap(&mut c, &mut d);                       // swap through &mut
    let boxed = Box::new(c);                         // move into the heap
    let v = vec![d];                                 // move into a Vec
    assert_eq!((boxed.x, v[0].x), (2, 1));
}
```

## How long a pin! value lives

`pin!(v)` moves `v` into a temporary. The temporary lives to the end of the enclosing block when
`pin!(..)` is the `let` initializer. It also lives that long inside a tuple, an array, a braced
struct literal, a `&`, a block tail, or an `if`, `else`, or `match` arm of that initializer. Inside
a tuple-struct or variant constructor such as `Some(..)`, it lives that long only since Rust 1.89.
As a function argument or a method receiver, it dies at the end of the statement:

- `let p = id(pin!(5u32)); println!("{}", *p);` gives `error[E0716]: temporary value dropped
  while borrowed`.
- `fn escape() -> Pin<&'static mut u32> { pin!(5u32) }` gives `error[E0515]: cannot return value
  referencing temporary value`.

Bind first (`let mut p = pin!(v);`), then pass `p.as_mut()` down. Use `Box::pin` when the pinned
value must outlive the function.

## pin! of a &mut reference

Since Rust 1.97, `pin!(r)` with `r: &mut T` always gives `Pin<&mut &mut T>`. This call fails:

```rust,compile_fail,E0308
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
use std::pin::{pin, Pin};

struct S { n: u32, _p: PhantomPinned }

fn takes(p: Pin<&mut S>) -> u32 { p.n }

fn by_ref(s: &mut S) -> u32 {
    takes(pin!(s))   // E0308 since 1.97: `pin!(s)` is `Pin<&mut &mut S>`
}
```

The error says ``expected `S`, found `&mut S` ``, and its help line names
`unreachable_pin_macro_type_constraint`. Change the parameter to `Pin<&mut S>`, or take `s: S` by
value and write `takes(pin!(s))`. Never use `unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(s) }` here, because the
caller can still move `*s` after the call returns.

## A named stack binding under Miri

The `make` function in the "Never pin a named stack binding" section of `SKILL.md` builds with no
diagnostic. Miri reports the read through the self-pointer after the move. The line numbers refer
to the probe, where `SelfRef` lives in a library crate:

```text
$ cargo +nightly miri run --bin stackescape
error: Undefined Behavior: memory access failed: alloc182 has been freed, so this pointer is dangling
help: alloc182 was allocated here:
 5 |     let mut s = SelfRef::new(0xAA);
help: alloc182 was deallocated here:
 8 | }
```

## A hand-rolled pinning macro

Tutorials show a two-line `macro_rules! pin` that shadows the caller's binding. As they give it,
the macro does not compile at a safe call site:

```text
error[E0133]: call to unsafe function `Pin::<Ptr>::new_unchecked` is unsafe and requires unsafe block
   |         let mut $name = Pin::new_unchecked(&mut $name);
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ call to unsafe function
   |     pin_hand!(a);
   |     ------------ in this macro invocation
```

The reflex fix is worse than the defect, because it compiles. Wrapping the **invocation** in
`unsafe { ... }` scopes the shadowing `let` to that block. The shadow dies at the closing brace,
the original binding comes back, and the value moves out:

```rust,run
use std::pin::Pin;

struct S { n: u32 }

macro_rules! pin_hand {
    ($name:ident) => {
        let mut $name = Pin::new_unchecked(&mut $name);
    };
}

fn takes_by_value(s: S) -> u32 { s.n }

fn main() {
    let mut a = S { n: 1 };
    unsafe { pin_hand!(a); }        // the shadow dies at this brace
    let n = takes_by_value(a);      // `a` is still an `S`, and still movable
    assert_eq!(n, 1);
}
```

That program compiles with two warnings (`unused_mut` and `unused_variables`) and runs. The pin
guarantee is gone. Use `std::pin::pin!`: it keeps the `unsafe` inside the macro body around the
call only, and it binds a temporary that no name reaches again.

## Choose the crate

| | `pin-project` | `pin-project-lite` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kind | proc macro, `#[pin_project]` | `macro_rules!`, `pin_project! { ... }` |
| Dependency tree | `syn`, `quote`, `proc-macro2` | none |
| Structs with named fields | yes | yes |
| Tuple structs and tuple variants | yes | no |
| Enums | yes, with `#[pin_project(project = Name)]` | yes, with `#[project = Name]` |
| Named projection type | `#[pin_project(project = Name)]` | `#[project = Name]` |
| Pinned destructor | `#[pin_project(PinnedDrop)]` plus `#[pinned_drop]` | `impl PinnedDrop` inside the macro body |
| Replace and take the old value | `#[pin_project(project_replace = Name)]` | `#[project_replace = Name]` |
| Explicit `!Unpin` marker | `#[pin_project(!Unpin)]` | `#[project(!Unpin)]`, or a `#[pin] PhantomPinned` field |
| Conditional `Unpin` of your own | `UnsafeUnpin` | no |
| `#[repr(packed)]` | rejected outright, dedicated message | `E0793` only when a field needs alignment above 1 |
| Error messages on bad input | readable | not useful; the crate docs suggest retrying the input with `pin-project` |

Take `pin-project-lite` when the dependency graph builds no proc-macro crate yet. The crate's
own documentation calls that its only advantage, and says it gives no benefit when proc-macro
dependencies are already in the graph. Take `pin-project` for a tuple struct, a tuple variant,
`UnsafeUnpin`, or the packed-struct check.

Both crates emit an `Unpin` impl conditioned on the `#[pin]` fields alone. That impl is more
permissive than the auto-derived one, which is the trap that
[Prove the Unpin result with a test](#prove-the-unpin-result-with-a-test) shows.

## Project in Future::poll

`project()` hands out `Pin<&mut F>` for a `#[pin]` field and a plain `&mut` for every other
field:

```rust
use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll, Waker};

pin_project! {
    /// Counts how many times the inner future is polled.
    pub struct Counted<F> {
        #[pin]
        inner: F,      // structurally pinned: `Future::poll` needs `Pin<&mut F>`
        polls: u32,    // not pinned: `&mut u32` is enough
    }
}

impl<F: Future> Future for Counted<F> {
    type Output = (F::Output, u32);
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        let this = self.project();      // Pin<&mut F> for `inner`, &mut u32 for `polls`
        *this.polls += 1;
        match this.inner.poll(cx) {
            Poll::Ready(v) => Poll::Ready((v, *this.polls)),
            Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut fut = Box::pin(Counted { inner: std::future::ready(7u8), polls: 0 });
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(Waker::noop());
    assert_eq!(fut.as_mut().poll(&mut cx), Poll::Ready((7, 1)));
}
```

## Prove the Unpin result with a test

A forgotten `#[pin]` attribute is silent. `fn assert_unpin<T: Unpin>() {}` states the result in
one line, and the direction of the test decides where it goes.

A type that you promise is `Unpin` takes a normal unit test:

```rust
use pin_project_lite::pin_project;

pin_project! { pub struct Buf { #[pin] inner: Vec<u8> } }

fn assert_unpin<T: Unpin>() {}

fn main() { assert_unpin::<Buf>(); }   // fails to compile if `inner` becomes !Unpin
```

A type that must stay `!Unpin` needs the opposite: the assertion has to fail. Put it in a
`compile_fail` doctest or a `trybuild` case, never in a normal test. A `compile_fail` doctest
passes on any compile error, so check the error text once by hand, or use `trybuild`, which
compares it on every run:

```rust,compile_fail,E0277
use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

pin_project! { struct Marked { #[pin] _p: PhantomPinned } }

fn assert_unpin<T: Unpin>() {}

fn main() { assert_unpin::<Marked>(); }
```

The failure text names the generated origin type, which is how you tell a macro-derived `Unpin`
from the auto one:

```text
error[E0277]: `PhantomPinned` cannot be unpinned
  | fn main() { assert_unpin::<Marked>(); }
  |                            ^^^^^^ within `__Origin<'_>`, the trait `Unpin` is not implemented for `PhantomPinned`
  = note: consider using the `pin!` macro
          consider using `Box::pin` if you need to access the pinned value outside of the current scope
note: required because it appears within the type `__Origin<'_>`
note: required for `Marked` to implement `Unpin`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__pin_project_make_unpin_impl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `pin_project`
```

A projection macro makes the forgotten attribute silent. Both macros replace the auto `Unpin`
impl with one that reads the `#[pin]` fields alone, so this compiles, and the struct is `Unpin`:

```rust
use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

pin_project! { struct Forgot { _p: PhantomPinned } }   // no #[pin]

fn assert_unpin<T: Unpin>() {}

fn main() {
    assert_unpin::<Forgot>();   // the struct is Unpin: the attribute was forgotten
}
```

## A destructor that moves a pinned field

`fn drop(&mut self)` receives `&mut self` even for a value that was pinned, as if the compiler
called `Pin::get_unchecked_mut` for you. A destructor can therefore move a structurally pinned
field out in plain safe code:

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;
use std::mem;

// `Holder` projects `inner` as structurally pinned, as `Wrapper` does in `SKILL.md`.
struct Holder { inner: SelfRef }

thread_local! { static STOLEN: Cell<Option<SelfRef>> = const { Cell::new(None) }; }

impl Drop for Holder {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Safe code that moves a structurally pinned field out of pinned storage.
        STOLEN.set(Some(mem::replace(&mut self.inner, SelfRef::new(0))));
    }
}
```

Miri (`cargo +nightly miri run --bin dropmove`) reports `memory access failed: allocN has been
freed, so this pointer is dangling` at the next read of the self-pointer. Use `PinnedDrop`, or the
inner-function pattern below.

## PinnedDrop with pin-project-lite

Put the impl inside the macro body. The receiver is `Pin<&mut Self>`, so no field can move out:

```rust
use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
use std::pin::Pin;

pin_project! {
    pub struct Conn<S> {
        #[pin]
        stream: S,
        id: u32,
    }
    impl<S> PinnedDrop for Conn<S> {
        fn drop(this: Pin<&mut Self>) {
            let this = this.project();
            println!("closing {}", this.id);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    drop(Box::pin(Conn { stream: (), id: 7 }));   // prints: closing 7
}
```

## PinnedDrop with pin-project

Pass `PinnedDrop` to the attribute, then write a separate `#[pinned_drop]` impl:

```rust
use pin_project::{pin_project, pinned_drop};
use std::pin::Pin;

#[pin_project(PinnedDrop)]
pub struct Conn<S> {
    #[pin]
    stream: S,
    id: u32,
}

#[pinned_drop]
impl<S> PinnedDrop for Conn<S> {
    fn drop(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {
        let this = self.project();
        println!("closing {}", this.id);
    }
}
```

A plain `impl Drop` beside either macro is a compile error. The message names a generated marker
trait, and the name differs per crate:

```text
$ cargo build --bin ppdrop            # pin-project
error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `SMustNotImplDrop` for type `S<_>`

$ cargo build --bin plitedrop         # pin-project-lite
error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `MustNotImplDrop` for type `S<_>`
```

## Pinned destruction without a macro

For a hand-written address-sensitive type, put the real destructor body in an inner function that
takes the pin. The signature then stops you from moving a field out:

```rust,run
use std::pin::Pin;

struct Conn { id: u32 }

impl Drop for Conn {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // SAFETY: the value is never used again after `drop` returns.
        inner_drop(unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(self) });

        fn inner_drop(this: Pin<&mut Conn>) {
            // The real destructor body. It cannot move a field out.
            assert!(this.id > 0);
        }
    }
}

fn main() { drop(Conn { id: 1 }); }
```

## repr(packed): only one crate rejects it

`#[pin_project]` carries a dedicated check. It fires on every packed struct:

```text
error: #[pin_project] attribute may not be used on #[repr(packed)] types
4 | #[repr(packed)]
  |        ^^^^^^
```

`pin_project_lite::pin_project!` has no such check. It emits a
`#[forbid(unaligned_references, safe_packed_borrows)] fn __assert_not_repr_packed` helper that takes
a reference to every field. The error fires only when a field needs alignment above 1:

```text
error[E0793]: reference to field of packed struct is unaligned
3 | / pin_project! {
4 | |     #[repr(packed)]
5 | |     struct S { #[pin] p: PhantomPinned, n: u64 }
6 | | }
  = note: this struct is 1-byte aligned, but the type of this field may require higher alignment
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__pin_project_struct_make_proj_method` which comes from the expansion of the macro `pin_project`
```

Change `n: u64` to `n: u8`, and every field is 1-byte aligned. The check stays quiet, the struct
compiles, and `.project()` hands out `Pin<&mut PhantomPinned>` for the packed field. Do not treat
`pin-project-lite` as a guard against `#[repr(packed)]`. Reject packed layouts yourself.

Neither check reaches a hand-written projection. `unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut packed) }`
compiles with no diagnostic at all.

## Assign into a pinned value

`Pin::<Ptr>::set` needs only `Ptr: DerefMut`, with no `Unpin` bound. It is safe because it drops
the old value in place before it writes the new one, which keeps the drop guarantee:

```rust,run
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
use std::pin::pin;

struct S { id: u32, _p: PhantomPinned }

impl Drop for S {
    fn drop(&mut self) { println!("drop {}", self.id); }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = pin!(S { id: 1, _p: PhantomPinned });
    p.set(S { id: 2, _p: PhantomPinned });   // safe: drops the old S in place first
    assert_eq!(p.id, 2);
}
```

The program prints `drop 1`, then `drop 2`. Use `Pin::set` instead of
`unsafe { get_unchecked_mut() }` plus an assignment.

## A pinning pointer that pins nothing

`Pin<P>` promises a stable address for `P::Target`. The promise is empty when `P` stores the
target inline, because moving the `Pin<P>` value moves the target too:

```rust
use std::ops::{Deref, DerefMut};
use std::pin::Pin;

struct Inline<T>(T);                        // not a pointer: T lives inline
impl<T> Deref for Inline<T> { type Target = T; fn deref(&self) -> &T { &self.0 } }
impl<T> DerefMut for Inline<T> { fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T { &mut self.0 } }

fn build() -> Pin<Inline<SelfRef>> {
    let mut p = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(Inline(SelfRef::new(0xAA))) };
    p.as_mut().init();
    p            // moves the "pinned" SelfRef, and that is undefined behaviour
}
```

The line numbers refer to the probe, where `SelfRef` lives in a library crate:

```text
$ cargo +nightly miri run --bin derefinline
error: Undefined Behavior: memory access failed: alloc187 has been freed, so this pointer is dangling
12 |     pub unsafe fn read(&self) -> u8 { unsafe { *self.ptr } }
   |                                                ^^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
help: alloc187 was allocated here:
10 |     let mut p = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(Inline(SelfRef::new(0xAA))) };
help: alloc187 was deallocated here:
13 | }
```

The only move in that program is `p` leaving `build`. `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, and `Arc<T>` are sound
pinning pointers because the target lives in an allocation that a move of the pointer does not
touch.

For a pointer type that a caller may wrap in `Pin`:

- `Deref::Target` must live behind a real indirection, at an address that survives a move of the
  pointer.
- `Deref` and `DerefMut` must not move out of the pointee, and must not invalidate it.
- `Drop` must not move out of the pointee, and must run its destructor before it frees storage.

## Review checklist

Use this list when you review code that pins or projects. Each item restates a rule from
`SKILL.md` or from this file:

- Every `Pin` in a signature sits on a `!Unpin` type, or a trait forces it.
- Every address-sensitive type is `!Unpin`: a `PhantomPinned` field (with `#[pin]` inside a
  projection macro), or a `!Unpin` attribute on the macro.
- No `Pin::new_unchecked` call outside `Drop::drop` takes `&mut` to a nameable binding, and no
  hand-written pinning macro exists in the tree.
- No `pin!(&mut x)`, or `pin!(r)` with `r: &mut T`, stands in for pinning the value itself.
- No hand-written `impl Unpin` sits next to a pinning projection.
- No manual `impl Drop` sits on a type with a structurally pinned field. `PinnedDrop` does.
- No pinned type is `#[repr(packed)]`.
- No projection exposes `take`, `replace`, or `swap` on a structurally pinned field.
- Every `map_unchecked_mut` and `get_unchecked_mut` call carries a `SAFETY:` comment that names
  the field and the choice.
- No pointer type that a caller may wrap in `Pin` stores its target inline.
